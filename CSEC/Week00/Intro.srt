00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Hello everyone, welcome to the subject Cybersecurity.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,400
As you could see here, the subject code is 48730 for undergraduate and 32548 for the

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,240
postgraduate students.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,760
So in the next few minutes, I'm going to introduce this subject in terms of what is important

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:34,520
in this subject, what we're going to study and why Cybersecurity has got such a prominent

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,680
place in the internet world.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,560
Myself is Prayadashinanda from School of Electrical and Data Engineering within the Faculty of

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,600
Engineering and IT.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:56,040
Now as you know, in the last few decades, the use of internet has been significant and when

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,520
there have been a lot of businesses who have transitioned from the standalone business

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,480
operation to internet-based, cloud-based, IoT-based operations, there are a lot of applications

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,960
which are also part of the internet.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,880
So when we say cyber, so cyber is a term where everything is connected to the internet and

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,720
securing those, everything is of utmost importance.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,760
So if you look at the term cyber security, so it actually evolved from various terminologies

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
in the past.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,400
For example, it started with the computer security.

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,240
Then when computers were interconnected, it became network security.

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,440
Then when information, massive amount of information were actually transmitted across the devices

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,720
in the network or in the internet, it became information security and as I said, application

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,440
security, business continuity, planning and so on.

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,040
So with all these things, we need to ensure that the operations, what we are doing over

23
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,040
the internet or over the cyber, they're actually protected.

24
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:20,880
So protection of software, hardware and various resources is of utmost importance.

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,720
And if you look at the data, like how cyber security has gained significant attention by

26
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:39,360
the industries, by businesses, by individuals, the Gardener report itself says by 2022, the

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,280
cyber security expenditure or the budget will be something around one trillion US dollar.

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,160
And that exactly tells you the importance of cyber security.

29
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,360
The most important thing in the cyber security while we're doing all this security aspect

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,320
for protecting the device, protecting the application, protecting the business, protecting

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,320
the personal information, because the attackers are getting more and more active in the last

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,560
few decades.

33
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,960
They are using various kinds of things such as various methodologies, various tools, various

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,800
advanced mechanisms to get your information, to violate the cyber space.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,200
So essentially, when you say the attackers, the attackers basically targeting everything

36
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:39,120
which are connected to the internet and we have a lot of stories in the past few years.

37
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:50,800
So we start our discussion in this subject, going through say hackers, malware, ransomware,

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,200
we'll also go through many case studies, how actually over the last few years the importance

39
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,640
of cyber security is so prominent.

40
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,080
And always remember the attackers always deliberately attack for financial or some kind of personal

41
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,800
motives.

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:19,440
So what we're actually going to learn in this particular subject is understanding those

43
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,080
attacks, understanding the technological aspect of the attacks, understanding the management

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,400
aspect of the attacks and of course the socio economical aspect of the attack.

45
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,840
So where we say the policy, the governance and all those things will come into picture.

46
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:48,040
So the security elements within the cyber security that is very fast, it starts from

47
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,840
the cyber crime to cyber harassment to cyber bullying, cyber surveillance, foreign seeks

48
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,200
and so many areas where actually these storms have been applied.

49
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:07,040
So as I mentioned, we have to be very careful when we are actually participating in the

50
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,640
internet internet era.

51
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,120
So the next question happens, how cyber security is different from other security.

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,720
Now I just now told you that there are various storms which are associated with cyber security

53
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,960
and cyber security basically right now is an umbrella which covers all those other security

54
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,400
aspects including the information security, network security, internet security and so

55
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
on.

56
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,440
So protecting the hardware, protecting the software, protecting the application, protecting the

57
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,080
user is the most important aspect what we are going to learn in this introductory level

58
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,240
cyber security subject.

59
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:58,440
As you know, the internet has transformed itself in a massive way like no other technology.

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,000
So if you look at the history of the internet like 30, 40 years back, so it was a platform

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,240
which was basically intended to communicate with each other.

62
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,600
When I said communicate, nobody ever thought at that point of time, the voice video and

63
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,080
every kind of communication right.

64
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,760
And as the technology progressed, a lot of things happened on the internet and that's

65
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,920
why we see ourselves being part of the internet and being an integral part of the internet

66
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,280
sharing information, sharing videos, sharing charts, sharing lectures, even going to the

67
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,600
extent of real-time application like operating on a patient monitoring and being getting

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
advice from the doctor over the internet which is in real time.

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,840
When all these things are happening on the internet, the bad guys are bad guys.

70
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:59,640
So basically they always try to interfere in your business and in this case the business

71
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,120
is information.

72
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:10,040
So if you see in the past few years there have been many documents which outlines how cyber

73
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,640
security is important.

74
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,040
And every day you find maybe hundreds or sometimes thousands of security breaches which are happening

75
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,840
around the world across the businesses.

76
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,560
It's not actually targeted to individual or specific business but across the businesses.

77
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,400
So it is very important to have a proper understanding what those security terms involved with cyber

78
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,160
security means.

79
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,440
So if you see here, I mean one of the things is internet of things, giving you an example

80
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,520
and similarly other objects can be also can play input and role on the cyberspace.

81
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,520
So the vast exponential increase in terms of huge of internet of things objects or which

82
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,120
are basically the small tiny sensor devices gives you an example of how much data those

83
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,280
devices are actually generating.

84
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,120
And those data needs to be secured from every angle.

85
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,800
It should be private, it should be, the internet should be protected, the authenticity, who

86
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:24,000
is actually going to use the internet or the devices that should be protected so that they

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,320
can be applied to various application areas and the application area can start from the

88
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:37,160
healthcare to automotive, you know, intelligent transport system to with elaborate applications

89
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,120
like the freeze, the toaster, like the tea kettle, they're all connected to the internet

90
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
nowadays.

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,400
And many people they actually connect all these devices to get some fun out of that connectivity.

92
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:59,280
Okay, so essentially the huge growth of IoT has also generated a lot of data in the cyberspace.

93
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,720
So and the most important thing is that when we actually connect to the internet or the

94
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,720
cyberspace, very few people actually think about the security aspect, they simply get

95
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,160
a connection and then get connected, okay.

96
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,400
And that is exactly the breeding ground for the cyber attackers, how they can learn all

97
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,080
those information and learns the attack.

98
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:32,040
So the main importance or the main objectives of cyber security is to keep the bad guys

99
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,600
out at the same time, protect your information resources.

100
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,920
And that covers everything around like how we can protect against unauthorized users,

101
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,320
how we can protect against the man in the middle attack, how we can protect against preserving

102
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,040
the data in its original form, okay.

103
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,480
So encryption, decryption, those are the terms which are actually part of the security measures

104
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,480
what one can consider.

105
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,600
And these are the important technology area.

106
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,880
So if you look at the look in the last few years, how the applications have been emerging

107
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,760
and how the applications are being there in the cyberspace.

108
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,240
So you'll see the critical infrastructure, mobile computing, social networking, which

109
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:33,520
is very widely being used by people, by businesses, like Twitter, the LinkedIn, Facebook, and

110
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,400
there are hundreds of such attacks which are happening in these platforms and we'll have

111
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,600
to be careful about that.

112
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Cloud computing, trusted infrastructure, like how we use the certificates and all, big

113
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,160
data, internet of things.

114
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,800
The most important thing what we need to understand and what we will be studying in this subject

115
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,440
is how to protect ourselves.

116
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,840
The moment you actually connect to the internet or the cyberspace, your data, your 100% your

117
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,000
data is being exposed.

118
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,360
Whether it is protected and if it is protected up to what extent is the thing what you should

119
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,120
consider before you actually connect.

120
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:21,120
So there is a say with sales, think before you connect, because if you don't think before

121
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,640
you connect to the cyber infrastructure or cyberspace, you are essentially exposing yourself

122
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,160
to the attacks and that's why all these security measures are in place, whether it is at the

123
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,200
user name or whether in the network site or in the server site or in the cloud, if you

124
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,960
are part of the cloud because most of the business is now they are actually operating

125
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
on the cloud.

126
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,720
There are various standards and standard bodies, we also have a focus on those standard

127
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,760
bodies and for example the National Institute of Standards and Technology need which is

128
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:04,360
a US standardization body and they are basically very active in terms of you know, satisfying

129
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,760
or standardizing the security documents.

130
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,600
In this society, everything starting from the software to hardware to protocol, everything

131
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,280
actually they actually are very active in this particular space.

132
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,640
International telecommunication union mainly governing the telecommunication aspect, telecommunication

133
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,840
protocol but then in an integrated network, your telecommunication is also part of the

134
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,320
cyberspace.

135
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,240
So there are also a lot of standardization documents you will find.

136
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,680
International standardization or international organization for standardization is basically

137
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:51,160
the one which was very actively involved and is being involved in the computer network.

138
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:59,440
For example OSI, several are architecture, how the network was evolved and so on.

139
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,200
In Australia we have the Australian Signal Directorate which is AST, they also produce

140
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:13,080
a lot of documents based on their observation on how the cyber security attacks or cyber

141
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,320
attacks are actually happening.

142
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:23,560
So I would expect you all to have a quick look at all these standardization body and

143
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,480
to get an idea about how they work.

144
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,680
So there are a lot of things happening in the cyberspace, starting from cyber warfare

145
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:43,040
to terrorism, at national level, at international level, cyber hooliganism, fake news, now a

146
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:50,360
lot of research right now on the fake news, how to detect the fake news, how do is because

147
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,040
anybody can now type any word and can find some kind of resources from the Google.

148
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:04,480
But then how through are those news, whether they are fake or they are authentic.

149
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,000
That is very important and that is a big area in the cyberspace.

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,360
Privacy, you know you are seeing a lot of documents, a lot of information every day, how the privacy

151
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,080
of the user are being attacked, taking example of Facebook data, Google data, my master card

152
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,680
data, there are a lot of privacy, policy, things that also happen.

153
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,640
Privacy related things are happening.

154
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:38,000
So the challenge is with all these odds when we have a steady and significant increase

155
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,320
in technology, we have a lot of policies being adapted or being developed by the organization.

156
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Law and enforcement authority, they are actually looking for how to make those information

157
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,560
and extract those information from the cyberspace to prove some kind of quote of law.

158
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:03,000
When all these challenges are there, the most important thing is how do we actually protect

159
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,280
ourselves as well as the businesses.

160
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,880
So the main essence of cyber security starts with three principles or three terms, one

161
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,920
is called confidentiality, nobody can see your information.

162
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,480
So if it is between Bob and Jackie, so only Bob and Jackie know what they have to see

163
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,280
from each other.

164
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,440
Confidentity, integrity, somebody can sniff into the information what you are sending

165
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,800
at the cyberspace or in the internet and can change.

166
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,520
Say for example, you have a stock broker and you are asking the stock broker to and you

167
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,440
are using a shared channel, secure channel to talk to your stock broker to buy 20 shares.

168
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,080
Now the man in the middle, somebody actually listening to the channel and changes from

169
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,880
20 shares to 2000 shares.

170
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,960
So that is called integrity violation.

171
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,280
The information is being changed, availability, whenever you want the information, what the

172
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,320
secured information, what you want to obtain should be available, particularly in relation

173
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,280
to when you are connecting to your bank, you should get your information securely.

174
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
That is availability.

175
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:24,640
Your information should be available when you want and as a legitimate authentic user.

176
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,520
So how you are going to focus in this subject will start with some kind of, you know, because

177
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,560
the cyber security actually originated from network security.

178
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:40,160
So we will be actually understanding how those network systems are attacked going through

179
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:48,280
the security aspects of your TCP IP protocol or HTTP protocol or OSI protocol level and

180
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,520
so on.

181
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:57,520
So going from there, most of the attacks actually are happening through the browser, right, at

182
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,000
the application level and how we protect the browsers, all the functionalities of the

183
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
browsers.

184
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,640
Many people, they don't know how to set the browser to its proper configuration, setting

185
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,800
up all the security features.

186
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,080
So we will also talk about secure protocols such as, you know, secure online transactions,

187
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:30,800
your shopping, making use of the underlying protocol, which is called SSH or TSL or SSL

188
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
or VPN, okay.

189
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,480
Then we will be talking about detection system, which are involved with integer detection

190
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,720
system, integer prevention system, how we monitor the traffic and the behavior of the

191
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,280
user intelligently, going from there, we will have some discussion on the policy aspect

192
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,960
of cyber security, which is mainly to be given by two guest lectures in this semester.

193
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
And they will be talking about the security risk, security governance, security, you know,

194
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,040
threat intelligence, cyber policy and so on.

195
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,240
So what we actually expect in this subject for you to be engaged with is some kind of,

196
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,600
you know, interactive learning, student input and case studies and we'll be actually

197
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:23,800
I'll be taking every week the lecture and then we'll have time to discuss about what

198
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,200
we actually covered in the lecture as well as getting your question and answering your

199
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
questions.

200
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,080
We'll have some practical aspects, so we'll be using virtual environment to learn few

201
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,680
of the attacks and how to protect against the attacks.

202
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,880
In cyberspace, one thing is very clear, you cannot actually play on the light traffic.

203
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,000
So you have to test it using some kind of simulation tools, software tools or some kind

204
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
of, you know, offline checking, okay.

205
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,320
So that is how actually this subject is being organized.

206
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,040
So we have some other subjects, which are also follow which follows this subject, basically

207
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:14,480
this subject is a prerequisite all these subjects, for example, 4104200, so which is mainly on

208
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
cryptography.

209
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,240
Even if in this subject, we will touch some of the cryptographic techniques, but we will

210
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,360
not go that depth into the cryptography.

211
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:32,480
So this subject 41900 and 420000, so they actually cover every aspect of the photograph.

212
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,800
Network security appearances, so which is a Cisco subject, and that will focus on, you

213
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,120
know, how to implement the security standards, security policies, security protocols, making

214
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,320
use of some kind of, you know, Cisco equipments.

215
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,880
Digital foreign says, as I told you just a couple of minutes back, that is a specialized

216
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,440
area of cyber security and very much integrated within the cyber space, because everybody

217
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,880
wants to investigate what information is that important to find the clue for a case.

218
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,240
So that is how the digital foreign six is also getting momentum with the cyber security.

219
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,960
IoT security, that is another subject which we offer, 42037, that talks about how to

220
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:25,520
secure the IoT devices, starting from a device level to protocol level to a system level

221
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
and so on.

222
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,240
Okay, so you will find a number of subjects which are being part of or which are actually

223
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,120
successor of this cyber security subject.

224
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,960
So that's why this subject is an introductory level subject which will expose you into various

225
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,240
aspect, a variety of aspect in the cyber space.

226
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,840
As you know, all the sources related to this subject will be maintained in the canvas.

227
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,200
Lectures will be conducted every week using the zoom session and the lecture will be

228
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,680
recorded as well as the discussion after the lecture will be recorded and that will be

229
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,080
basically posted once the lecture is finished.

230
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,640
The lab and tutorials, most of the labs and tutorials this semester will be first of

231
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,680
this, particularly for the undergraduate students, for the postgraduate students, those

232
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:21,280
who are absorbed will be conducting online.

233
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,400
All assessments related to this subject will be conducted online.

234
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,760
So as a result of that, so I would advise you to check your canvas site regularly and

235
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,680
also the emails and notifications which will be going from me as well as from your lab

236
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,920
tutors.

237
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,320
So that is how basically we will explore a lot of things in this subject.

238
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,160
We will get to know what is, what are the different protocols, what are the mechanisms,

239
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,360
how actually we implement the cyber defense strategy.

240
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,440
The objective of this subject is not to make you a hacker very clearly, I am telling you,

241
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,880
but you understand what is involved in hacking.

242
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,640
You do not ask you to be a hacker, but we want you to understand how actually to defend

243
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,440
the system against the hackers.

244
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,560
Thank you very much, get involved in this subject, both in attending the lectures, Agilage, understanding

245
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:30,840
the lab aspects by implementing and instructions will be given to you for that and make this

246
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,480
subject interesting.

247
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:41,800
Thank you very much and hope to see you next week in our regular first week lecture.

248
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Thank you.
