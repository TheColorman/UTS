# Quiz 02 Part II

## Description

Write a program to prompt the user to input an integer n, and display a triangle pattern with n number of rows.

Sample run
A sample run of the program if the user input was 4 is as follows:

```txt
Enter an integer>
4
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
```

Another sample run of the program if the user input was 3 is given as follows:

```txt
Enter an integer>
3
   *
  ***
 *****
```

For any input less than 1 should print an error message as follows:

```txt
Enter an integer>
-1
Input must be greater or equal to 1
```

## Submission

You should complete the code provided in quiz2.c file to the right of quiz description. (If you cannot see quiz1.c file, click on the drop down list and select 'Reset to Scaffold' option. Note that doing so would any code you may have typed and you might want to save a backup before doing so.)

Your can submit your code by clicking 'Mark' button at the right bottom corner. By clicking Mark you agree that this is your own work, and followed all instructions in the specification.

## Sample executable

Sample executable is attached in the Scaffold. Develop your own source code. Behaviour of your program MUST BE IDENTICAL to the sample executable provided - every single character including spaces.

## Testing process

Your program should compile with NO errors and NO warnings. Ed will automatically compare your source code to the sample executable. Feedback is provided immediately. You are allowed unlimited number of attempts before the deadline. No late submissions are accepted - no exceptions to this rule. The submission page will show the total number of tests and the marks granted to your submission. The marks for this part of the quiz done on Ed will NOT show in UTSOnline Grade Book immediately.

ALL tests are mandatory. When you pass one test, the next test will be revealed. Ed will also show the marks for each test case progressively. If your program does not compile due to filename error, syntax error or any other error, you will receive 0 marks for the attempt.

Do NOT hardcode your answers. Tutors will randomly check the submissions. If you hardcode your solution, tutors may change your marks to 0.
