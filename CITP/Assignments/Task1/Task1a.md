# Task 1a: Feedback

The feedback I received can be broadly categorised into two main points:  

1. Finish unfinished sections of the report.  
2. Expand on sections to support my arguments.  

These two points can be combined into a plan, that being that I should expand on sections by filling out unfinished parts.  

The feedback for the second point revolved around expanding on my background explanations by filling in more information. This will make the reader more informed, and will help support the arguments I make in the report. There are four places that has received this kind of feedback.

The first is related to my introduction of Saibai Island, where the feedback requests that I focus more on how climate change has impacted Saibai's infrastructure. This makes sense, as I repeatedly mention climate change as one of the main causes for infrastructure issues without backing it up with sources.

The second is where I argue that the cost of intrastructure maintenence is outpacing the funding received by the TSIRC, where the feedback asks me to expand on the issue of funding for the TSIRC. I can see this being useful to understand how/why the TSIRC is underfunded, but I don't think it's entirely necessary to answer my reseach question.

The final two points of feedback are related to a more in-depth explanation of the importance of critical infrastructure, as well as "ranking" critical infrastructure by importance to substantiate my arguments claiming the importance of critical infrastructure and its timely repair. This is definitely important feedback, as I only use a single source to claim that critical infrastructure is important, without expanding on why.
